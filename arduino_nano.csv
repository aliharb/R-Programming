"1",2016-06-22,"centenary","Like some other reviewers",3,"Like some other reviewers, my Pro Micro seemed to be losing the sketch when disconnected from power.  However, I've now figured out that the Pro Micro isn't actually losing the sketch, there is a different problem altogether.  When the Pro Micro is reconnected to power, for some reason the bootloader isn't running the sketch.  If you then do a soft-reset by connecting the RST pin to ground, upon reset the bootloader starts running the sketch successfully.So the issue can be worked around by wiring a button to the RST pin and hitting the button every time you plug in the Pro Micro so that it will reset and run the sketch.  It's annoying that the issue exists, but at least it's workable."
"2",2015-12-17,"Mike Moore","Would buy again",5,"It's an Arduino the size of two postage stamps... what's not to love?Like others, tried to let Windows discover drivers.  It didn't.  No surprise.  Tried the first like on the Amazon page.  It also didn't work.  Had my friend Google find the driver - ArduinoEd had it.  Loaded driver and it works great.UPDATE JAN 2016:  Plugged it into a Windows 7 laptop and walked away.  Came back 5 minutes later and it was completing the driver installation."
"3",2015-12-20,"Richard DeMar","A very cool, very tiny Arduino!",5,"I only just got two of these today and only just got it working a few minutes ago, so that's why the three stars. Don't take it personally or seriously - I have only run a simple LED flasher on it and don't have enough experience on it yet to rate it yet higher. I will add more to this review as I go along. Meanwhile, I will say this much:1) It's TINY, only 1/6th or less the size of my Sunfounder Mega 2560. The pin rows on both are splayed just enough to cause insert problems with my Global Specialties breadboards, but a little quick work needlenose pliers (only a few pins at once, moving along gently) straightened it up fine. Then, the big problem became insertion itself - the pins are quite thick and so many at once going into a good breadboard takes A LOT of force. Gotta push hard and wiggle over and over, it's a challenge.2) The driver was a little work to find but not terribly so. I use Windows 7 Professional 64 bit and I used the Win 7 driver from here:http://www.arduined.eu/ch340g-converter-windows-7-driver-download/Worked right away, all I had to do was pick \"Arduino Nano\" from the Arduino Sketch program device list, and then I had to make sure to pick Com 5 from the ports list. After that, no problemo senior, BlinkWithoutDelay works perfectly on it. The onboard LED is tied to Digital 13 so it's a little different from the PWM Pin 13 that I am used to on my Mega, but whatever. One thing at a time, right?My first goal is to remove the Mega from my slowly developing SBM-19 Geiger Counter design, and replace it with one of these. So, let's upload the program (yes, you get to experience it right along with me, so wish me luck here...) and yay it's up there... and WOW, uses a lot more memory for the same program, but that's fine since I knew these have less than the Mega and there's still plenty left. Down the road, that may cramp my style with project but again, one thing at a time.Next step, removing the Mega and inserting the Nano between the Geiger pulse circuit and the 16x02 LCD. Here goes... Ok, everything is hopped over. I could get away with just two breadboards now I see but I have the Nano on it's own small one so whatever. It won't matter once I start making PCBs for this thing. Ready for power.... Using the mini USB on the Nano...And oh hell yes, LCD came right up and displaying fine. Geiger is registering clicks but it's way less sensitive. Cause is...low voltage on the Geiger circuit. Excessive loading on the Nano's 5V bus I'm sure. No problem, the device is meant to be powered from Li-Ion anyway, and the Arduino is meant to be powered from the Geiger and not the other way around. Everything is working, anyway. It's counting events and displaying them just like it should, the speaker is clicking, and the.... yes! The mode selector inputs for the speaker sound type and sample rate are working exactly the same as with the Mega. All that lacks in any way is just the 5V source coming from the Nano. That could be a PIA with certain things in future., but again... one thing at a time.Oops... I moved the Geiger +5VDC line from the \"Vin\" pin on the Nano to the \"+5V\" pin on the Nano. All better. The Geiger circuit now has about 4.98VDC on the positive rail and the counts are back up to 80 - 90 CPM which is just about spot on normal for these big SBM-19 tubes. With the \"Vin\" pin powering it, I was only getting about 3.5V or something, so the tube was getting probably only a couple hundred volts where it should be about 350VDC - 400VDC, thus the sensitivity was crap. .So there you go... I did my first work with it as I typed the review and notice, no major problems? Pretty nice, I like it. I adore the tiny size, and I can forgive it the lesser memory just for that. The Mega is a beast, but not great for compactness in a project. This bugger appears to work fine for less complicated designs, and the small footprint is really great.So, for now... you know what? Screw it. Gonna rate her higher. For now, four stars. Maybe I'll jump it up to 5 later after I've done more with it. :-)BTW I tried to catch the onboard LED flash in the picture but it's really fast... The Geiger pulse is scarcely 30ms wide. It's plenty visible to the eye, just hard to catch on the camera without doing crazy things with shutter speed.A little update - 12-22-15: I can now verify that Digital Input #13 DOES NOT LIKE 400VDC, lol. I slipped and shorted the frickin Geiger 400VDC supply line right to the D13 input line, like, nice goin' Ace. I actually saw the bright blue, tiny spark and heard a tiny \"tick!\" as well. After that, nooooo input from D13 at all. I think the rest of the board is just fine, because the program never stopped running, and all the functions still worked like the audio mode select and sampling rate select, but no counts. I shelved the damaged Nano unit for other things and dropped in my second Nano unit as a replacement. Flashed the Geiger program to it, and kept going with testing and development with no further problems. Was of course tough as hell to pull the bad one and tough as hell to put the new one in, but I knew that was coming and I deserved it for my stupid slip up. I also think the Nano deserves 5 stars now as an award for being wounded in combat, lol. Still loving these things, still thinking they work just great, and still looking forward to more projects and getting a few more so I can make full out dedicated devices out of the projects that go especially well. :-)"
"4",2016-02-22,"Anthony Coghlan","Great little cost-effective board for experimenting",5,"The flood of inexpensive Arduino knock-offs reminds me of the 1980's battle for the desktop PC market.  It's hard to stomach paying 2-4x the price for the original brand-name article, especially if one just wants to experiment or needs to test a design idea cheaply.  So I, too, gave in.I was unsure how good the build quality would be at this price, but so far the board has worked very well and seems sturdy also.  I had no issues with bent pins in delivery or poor solder connections.  If you've worked with the Uno (already small), you'll be pleasantly surprised at the frankly tiny footprint of this variant.  I never found drivers for my older Mac (OS 10.4), but my Windows 10 machine recognized the device right away."
"5",2015-12-29,"JA","Great little alternative to an Arduino Uno",5,"I received this product for free or at a reduced cost for my honest feedback. Great little component when you don't have room for an Arduino Uno.  Des everything I needed it to do to control various projects and the compact form factor makes it great for prototyping. Will be getting more of these for sure. Cheap enough to use for throw-away sensors and sturdy enough to get the job done"
"6",2016-04-24,"Hamsterman","Complete with Bootloader!",5,"The device came well-packaged with the pins in antistatic foam inside of a ESD/shielded bag. I had previously loaded the driver for the USB chip and so it was recognized instantly. It had a blink-type program already loaded, and it had no problem downloaded a new one. This means that it already had a bootloader installed, which is not always the case for these inexpensive boards. (If it has no bootloader, you can't just plug it in and program it.)It came with pins and header installed. One difference is that it uses red rather than blue LEDs. One odd thing was that the board came with a red velcro strap with OSOYOO printed on it. I doubt it is ESD compliant so I just used my normal wriststrap when handling it."
"7",2015-12-03,"Edward Smith","This Nano is a nice version of the Arduino board",5,"I purchased both the Arduino Nano and 20 in 1 Sensor kit for some projects I am working on.First the Nano board itself:This Nano is a nice version of the Arduino board. It's not an official board from what I can tell. It uses the CH340 chip for it's serial interface and not the FTDI chip that official ones use. Honestly, aside from having to get the driver from online it's been a non-issue for me. In fact from what I've read I've fared much better than folks with board using faked out FTDI chips. Overall the board has been performing very well as a test bed in my breadboard. I can't see any reason I won't stick with this particular board/vendor in the future.20 in 1 Sensor kit:I've only used a few of the sensors so far. Namely the Temp/Humidity, IR, and RGB LED. The Temp & Humidity sensors seemed to work very well, I built a small project with kids and verified the readings with my IR Thermometer. The IR Sensor seems to work fine, but the RGB LED I received doesn't seem to want to work on the blue channel. I get Red-Green-Red on the three pins. I tested another RGB LED I had on hand and that one worked fine so it certainly appears to be an issue with this module and not my circuit. Not worth returning for me as I didn't buy this kit for that one module, but still it would be nice for the kids I am working with to see that that one piece work properly. Overall the kit has a nice assortment of sensors all contained in a small tackle box with a card to help you identify which component is which. Overall a fun experimenter kit for use in simple projects or in teaching basic electronics."
"8",2015-11-17,"Opaz","very bad.. this board came without boot loader and ...",1,"very bad.. this board came without boot loader and drivers will not recognized by windows because of a Chinese chip set.  Be aware that even when you have the right drivers, without the boot loader, this board is useless and trash. No one online will tell you the integrity of the board and the condition of the item you are getting. From my 20 years of experience on PCB and PCI boards, this board is not the original Nano and it has a obsolete chip that windows 7, XP, and windows 8, will not support the drivers anymore. I ended putting this board brand new to the recycle and trash because I would be ashamed to sale something is worthless for other students and pros. Sorry to be Honest."
"9",2016-03-28,"Steve Reinhardt","Caution; it's not exactly a Nano.",3,"Heads-up. This version of the Nano does -not- use the FTDI interface chip, and so does not use the standard drivers. Installation is not as instant as a genuine Arduino standard product. It does work, well, but you will need to Google for the driver info, and install that before you are up and running.So, it's inexpensive, but you need to know you've got about 10-15 minutes more effort to get it to play nicely with the Arduino framework."
"10",2016-05-02,"ryanvito","Awesome little piece of hardware.",5,"This little guy is awesome. In a few minutes I had a button wired up to do alt+ctrl+delete on a workstation that didn't have a keyboard. If you use Win7 the lock screen requires alt+ctrl+delete to type in your password and the on-screen keyboard can't do that key combo. Simple, easy to work with and has great documentation on the web. My PC recognized it as a keyboard instantly. Great buy!"
